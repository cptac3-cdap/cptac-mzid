checkMzMLsha1
=============

Usage: checkMzMLsha1 *.mzML
       checkMzMLsha1 *.mzML.gz

Checks the embedded SHA1 checksums in an mzML file against the source
files (declared in the XML) and the mzML file itself. Source or mzML
files with problematic checksums are output. If all checksums match,
then nothing is output.

Examples:

* Check SHA1 checksums converted mzML files after msconvertall:

  > checkMzMLsha1 *.mzML.gz
