title = CPTAC, TCGA Cancer Proteome Study of Breast Tissue
description = Global proteome and phosphoproteome data have been acquired for 105 TCGA breast cancer samples using iTRAQ (isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantification) protein quantification methods. Samples were selected from each of the 4 breast tumor subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, Basal-like, HER2-enriched) described in the publication, Comprehensive molecular portraits of human breast tumors (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, Nature 2012).

[Project:TCGA_Ovarian_Cancer]
title = CPTAC, TCGA Cancer Proteome Study of Ovarian Tissue
description = Global proteome data have been acquired for 174 TCGA ovarian cancer tumor samples by 2 Proteome Characterization Centers (PCCs), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU). Both PCCs used iTRAQ (isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantification) protein quantification methods. Thirty-two of the 174 TCGA tumor samples were assayed at both sites yielding a total of 206 proteome characterizations. Glycoproteome (122 tumors) and phosphoproteome (69 tumors) analyses were also conducted, at JHU and PNNL respectively.

[Project:ExosomeStudy]
title = Determining qualitative and quantitative differences in the protein, mRNA and miRNA content of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and their released exosomes 
description = Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immature myeloid cells that accumulate in the tumor microenvironment of most cancer patients. There MDSCs suppress both adaptive and innate immune responses, hindering immunotherapies. Moreover, many cancers are accompanied by inflammation, a processes that further intensifies MDSC suppressive activity, causing aggressive tumor progression and metastasis. MDSCs collected from tumor-bearing mice profusely release nano-scale membrane-bound extracellular vesicles, called exosomes, which carry biologically active proteins between cells and contribute directly to the immune suppressive functions of MDSC. Many studies on other cell types have shown that exosomes may also carry microRNAs (miRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) which can also be transferred to surrounding and distant cells. However, to the best of our knowledge, the miRNA and mRNA cargo of MDSC-derived exosomes has not yet been interrogated. This study aims to identify and quantify the cargo of MDSC and their immunosuppressive exosomes to gather knowledge that can offer insights on the mechanisms by which MDSCs contribute to immune suppression, focusing on the role of exosomes as intercellular communication mediators in the tumor microenvironment. In order to achieve our objective a well-established mouse model based on a conventional mammary carcinoma (4T1 cells) and heightened inflammation (4T1 transduced to express the cytokine interleukin-1b) was used. We provide evidence that MDSC-derived exosomes carry proteins, mRNAs and miRNAs. Relative quantitation demonstrated quantitative differences between the exosome cargo and the cargo of their parental cells, supporting the hypothesis that selective loading into the exosomes is possible. Additionally, quantitative and functional analyses of the exosome cargo generated under conventional and heightened inflammation conditions are consistent with clinical observations that inflammation is linked to cancer development.
